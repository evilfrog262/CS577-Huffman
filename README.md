CS577-Huffman
=============

Huffman Coding

Idea:  Implement the Huffman Coding algorithm discussed in class and in your text.   
Use your algorithm to compress text data from US Presidential Speeches. 
Details:  You will need to implement a dictionary data structure and you will need to 
compute the frequencies for words in the texts.   The website below gives speeches 
given you various US Presidents organized by period in history.   What we want you 
to do is use speeches from one period to compute frequencies and then use these 
frequencies to build a Huffman Code.   Then compress speeches from a different 
period.   Compare this to what happens if you use frequencies computed for a
particular period (for example, the Gilded Age) to compress speeches from the same 
age.
